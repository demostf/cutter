<h1>POV demo camera unlocker</h1>

Unlocks the camera in POV demos to allow the same controls as when viewing STV demos.

<p>Select a demo file below to begin processing, once processed the file will be presented as download</p>
<p>Processing demo files can take a while</p>
<form>
  <input type="number" id="start" value="30000">
  <input type="number" id="end" value="50000">
  <input type="file" id="file">
</form>

<p>
  Note:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The demo still being recorded as POV demo means that only data around the recording player is in the demo file, players not near the recorder will behave weirdly</li>
  <li>When the player respawns the freecam camera will be moved</li>
  <li>The resulting demo might not work or crash tf2 on playback in rare cases</li>
</ul>
